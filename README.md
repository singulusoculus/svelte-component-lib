# Svelte Component Library

A collection of my Svelte components and experiments for my personal use. Try them if you want but just know that many of these aren't production ready.

This library includes a global.scss file that has base resets, variables, and a responsive design. Need to install sass package to use.

```bash
npm install sass --save-dev
```

All components are written to be as stand-alone as possible with the exception of css variables found in the the global.scss file.

To get the theme-default and typo-default to load you must add these classes to the html element in app.html.
